# Calculator-Project
This is the very first project I've made. I learned how to code with Codecademy, and I wanted to start making projects to gain experience!
I decided to make a simple calculator using the tkinter library to make a simple GUI.
This project shows my ability to learn new library's, make simple functions, and even demonstrates the use of error exception when the user clicks more than one operator per equation.
I may try to add some more functionality in the future as I gain some more experience.
