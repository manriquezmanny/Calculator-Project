# Calculator-Project
This is the very first project I've made. I learned how to code with Codecademy, and I wanted to start making projects to gain experience!
I decided to make a simple calculator using the tkinter library to make a simple GUI.
This project shows my ability to learn new library's, use simple functions, and even demonstrates the use of error exception.
I may try to add some more functionality in the future as I gain some more experience.
